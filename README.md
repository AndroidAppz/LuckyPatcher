# Lucky Patcher by Chelpus

Lucky Patcher is a great Android tool to remove ads, modify apps permissions, backup and restore apps, bypass premium applications license verification, and more.

To use all features, you need a rooted device.

Note :
Although stable, functioning of Lucky Patcher can't be 100% guaranteed.
So, you are solely responsible for the use of this application and any problems that may occur on your device (rebooting loop, unstable system, etc...).
